# Do You Love Me?

A funny and interactive web project that asks the ultimate question:  
**“Do you love me?”** 💘

- If you say **Yes**, you'll be redirected.
- If you say **No**... the button will grow and grow until it takes over the screen 😈

This project is just for fun and DOM manipulation practice.
